# RandyLab

This project is an experiment. After viewing
[this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N-kgCqy2xs), I became inspired
to take a step out of my normal web related programming comfort zone to try something
new and totally different.

## Current Status

We are currently at learn to crawl status.

## Goals

* Full 3D OpenGL ES2.0 scene management
* Custom rendering engine
* Animation
* Skeletal animation
* Support for parametric surfaces
* Billboarding
* Other stuff I don't know about yet

Portions of the code are based on "Beginning Android Games" and other random websites
I've seen on the Internet. Soon there will be a license for this mess, but for now I would
not encourage anyone to run this as it may slap your momma, kick your dog, or start thermonuclear war.
